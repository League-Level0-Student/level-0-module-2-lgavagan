    //3. make the ellipse a nice color

    //4. If the mouse is pressed change the X co-ordinate so that the dot moves to the right

    //5. Make your dot move faster
    //  (you have to figure out what part of your code to change)

    //2. Draw an ellipse of height and width 10. Make sure to use your variable for the X position.
 
    //6. Use the playSound() method to play a ding when your dot crosses the finish line.
